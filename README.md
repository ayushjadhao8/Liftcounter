# Liftcounter
Verilog-Based Lift Occupancy Counter Design

Designed a 4-bit up/down counter for a lift occupancy system using T-type flip-flops and control logic.

Implemented Full and Empty state detection to prevent overflow/underflow.

Developed efficient debounce mechanisms using push-button control for accurate input handling.
